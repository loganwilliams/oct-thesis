abstract = {Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a rapid and cost-effective method for obtaining a first-line diagnosis of a palpable mass of the breast. However, because it can be difficult to manually discriminate between adipose tissue and the fibroglandular tissue more likely to harbor disease, this technique is plagued by a high number of nondiagnostic tissue draws. We have developed a portable, low coherence interferometry (LCI) instrument for FNAB guidance to combat this problem. The device contains an optical fiber probe inserted within the bore of the fine gauge needle and is capable of obtaining tissue structural information with a spatial resolution of 10 mum over a depth of approximately 1.0 mm. For such a device to be effective clinically, algorithms that use the LCI data must be developed for classifying different tissue types. We present an automated algorithm for differentiating adipose tissue from fibroglandular human breast tissue based on three parameters computed from the LCI signal (slope, standard deviation, spatial frequency content). A total of 260 breast tissue samples from 58 patients were collected from excised surgical specimens. A training set (N=72) was used to extract parameters for each tissue type and the parameters were fit to a multivariate normal density. The model was applied to a validation set (N=86) using likelihood ratios to classify groups. The overall accuracy of the model was 91.9\% (84.0 to 96.7) with 98.1\% (89.7 to 99.9) sensitivity and 82.4\% (65.5 to 93.2) specificity where the numbers in parentheses represent the 95\% confidence intervals. These results suggest that LCI can be used to determine tissue type and guide FNAB of the breast.},

Here, we describe a first step toward a POC OFDI system by demonstrating a miniaturized swept-wavelength source. The laser is based on a tunable optical filter using a reflection grating and a miniature resonant scanning mirror. The laser achieves 75 nm of bandwidth centered at 1340 nm, a 0.24 nm instantaneous line width, a 15.3 kHz repetition rate with 12 mW peak output power, and a 30.4 kHz A-line rate when utilizing forward and backward sweeps. The entire laser system is approximately the size of a deck of cards and can operate on battery power for at least one hour.},

Thus, our phase stabilization method is simple and can be employed in a variety of SS-OCT systems. The bidirectional blood flow and vasculature in the deep choroid was successfully imaged via two Doppler modes that use different time intervals for Doppler processing.

@article{Kahrs2012,
abstract = {During endoscopic procedures it is often desirable to determine the distance between anatomical features. One such clinical application is percutaneous cochlear implantation (PCI), which is a minimally invasive approach to the cochlea via a single, straight drill path and can be achieved accurately using bone-implanted markers and customized microstereotactic frame. During clinical studies to validate PCI, traditional open-field cochlear implant surgery was performed and prior to completion of the surgery, a customized microstereotactic frame designed to achieve the desired PCI trajectory was attached to the bone-implanted markers. To determine whether this trajectory would have safely achieved the target, a sham drill bit is passed through the frame to ensure that the drill bit would reach the cochlea without damaging vital structures. Because of limited access within the facial recess, the distances from the bit to anatomical features could not be measured with calipers. We hypothesized that an endoscope mounted on a sliding stage that translates only along the trajectory, would provide sufficient triangulation to accurately measure these distances. In this paper, the design, fabrication, and testing of such a system is described. The endoscope is mounted so that its optical axis is approximately aligned with the trajectory. Several images are acquired as the stage is moved, and three-dimensional reconstruction of selected points allows determination of distances. This concept also has applicability in a large variety of rigid endoscopic interventions including bronchoscopy, laparoscopy, and sinus endoscopy.},

abstract = {In this manuscript, a GRIN (gradient index) lens rod based probe for endoscopic spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) with dynamic focus tracking is presented. Current endoscopic OCT systems have a fixed focal plane or working distance. In contrast, the focus of this endoscopic OCT probe can dynamically be adjusted at a high speed (500 mm/s) without changing reference arm length to obtain high quality OCT images for contact or non-contact tissue applications, or for areas of difficult access for probes. The dynamic focusing range of the probe can be from 0 to 7.5 mm without moving the probe itself. The imaging depth is 2.8 mm and the lateral scanning range is up to 2.7 mm or 4.5 mm (determined by the diameter of different GRIN lens rods). Three dimensional imaging can be performed using this system over an area of tissue corresponding to the GRIN lens surface. The experimental results demonstrate that this GRIN lens rod based OCT system can perform a high quality non-contact in vivo imaging. This rigid OCT probe is solid and can be adapted to safely access internal organs, to perform front or side view imaging with an imaging speed of 8 frames per second, with all moving parts proximal to the GRIN lens, and has great potential for use in extremely compact OCT endoscopes for in vivo imaging in both biological research and clinical applications.},

In this case, an immersion method for optical clearing of biological tissues can provide a possible solution to this problem, because the application of biocompatible clearing agents can reduce light scattering. Optical clearing represents a promising approach to increasing the imaging depth for various techniques, for example, various spectroscopy and fluorescent methods, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). We investigate the improvement of light penetration depth in blood after application of polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hemoglobin solutions using an OCT system. Influence of clearing agents on light transport in tissues and blood was also investigated in the mouse tail vein.},

abstract = {We report studies of the analyses of and compensation for group dispersion to improve the axial resolution of high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) by acousto-optic modulation (AOM). Theoretical modeling and experiments reveal that the high-order group dispersion induced by acousto-optic crystals broadens the measured coherence length (Lc) and thus degrades the axial resolution of OCT imaging. Based on our experimental studies, we can compensate for the dispersion to less than 50\% broadening of the source Lc by adjusting the grating-lens-based optical delay in the reference arm and can further eliminate it by inserting like acousto-optic crystals in the sample arm of the OCT system. The results demonstrate that this AOM-mediated OCT system permits high-performance OCT imaging at A-scan rates of as much as 4 kHz by use of a resonant scanner. Because of its ultrastable direct frequency modulation, this AOM-mediated OCT system can potentially improve the performance of high-speed Doppler OCT techniques.},
