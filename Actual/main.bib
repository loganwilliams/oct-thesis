abstract = {Remarkable sensitivity and exquisite frequency selectivity are hallmarks of mammalian hearing, but their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Cochlear insults and hearing disorders that decrease sensitivity also tend to broaden tuning, suggesting that these properties are linked. However, a recently developed mouse model of genetically altered hearing (Tectb(-/-)) shows decreased sensitivity and sharper frequency selectivity. In this paper, we show that the Tectb mutation reduces the spatial extent and propagation velocity of tectorial membrane (TM) travelling waves and that these changes in wave propagation are likely to account for all of the hearing abnormalities associated with the mutation. By reducing the spatial extent of TM waves, the Tectb mutation decreases the spread of excitation and thereby increases frequency selectivity. Furthermore, the change in TM wave velocity reduces the number of hair cells that effectively couple energy to the basilar membrane, which reduces sensitivity. These results highlight the importance of TM waves in hearing.},

@article{Goldberg2008,
abstract = {Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is a rapid and cost-effective method for obtaining a first-line diagnosis of a palpable mass of the breast. However, because it can be difficult to manually discriminate between adipose tissue and the fibroglandular tissue more likely to harbor disease, this technique is plagued by a high number of nondiagnostic tissue draws. We have developed a portable, low coherence interferometry (LCI) instrument for FNAB guidance to combat this problem. The device contains an optical fiber probe inserted within the bore of the fine gauge needle and is capable of obtaining tissue structural information with a spatial resolution of 10 mum over a depth of approximately 1.0 mm. For such a device to be effective clinically, algorithms that use the LCI data must be developed for classifying different tissue types. We present an automated algorithm for differentiating adipose tissue from fibroglandular human breast tissue based on three parameters computed from the LCI signal (slope, standard deviation, spatial frequency content). A total of 260 breast tissue samples from 58 patients were collected from excised surgical specimens. A training set (N=72) was used to extract parameters for each tissue type and the parameters were fit to a multivariate normal density. The model was applied to a validation set (N=86) using likelihood ratios to classify groups. The overall accuracy of the model was 91.9\% (84.0 to 96.7) with 98.1\% (89.7 to 99.9) sensitivity and 82.4\% (65.5 to 93.2) specificity where the numbers in parentheses represent the 95\% confidence intervals. These results suggest that LCI can be used to determine tissue type and guide FNAB of the breast.},

Images and motion measurements are obtained using phase-resolved analysis of the interference signal. The DOCM system permits imaging with micron-scale resolution and 85-dB sensitivity and motion measurements with 100-kHz bandwidth, directional discrimination, and 30-pm/Hz(0.5) noise floor.

@article{Kahrs2012,
abstract = {During endoscopic procedures it is often desirable to determine the distance between anatomical features. One such clinical application is percutaneous cochlear implantation (PCI), which is a minimally invasive approach to the cochlea via a single, straight drill path and can be achieved accurately using bone-implanted markers and customized microstereotactic frame. During clinical studies to validate PCI, traditional open-field cochlear implant surgery was performed and prior to completion of the surgery, a customized microstereotactic frame designed to achieve the desired PCI trajectory was attached to the bone-implanted markers. To determine whether this trajectory would have safely achieved the target, a sham drill bit is passed through the frame to ensure that the drill bit would reach the cochlea without damaging vital structures. Because of limited access within the facial recess, the distances from the bit to anatomical features could not be measured with calipers. We hypothesized that an endoscope mounted on a sliding stage that translates only along the trajectory, would provide sufficient triangulation to accurately measure these distances. In this paper, the design, fabrication, and testing of such a system is described. The endoscope is mounted so that its optical axis is approximately aligned with the trajectory. Several images are acquired as the stage is moved, and three-dimensional reconstruction of selected points allows determination of distances. This concept also has applicability in a large variety of rigid endoscopic interventions including bronchoscopy, laparoscopy, and sinus endoscopy.},

abstract = {In this manuscript, a GRIN (gradient index) lens rod based probe for endoscopic spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) with dynamic focus tracking is presented. Current endoscopic OCT systems have a fixed focal plane or working distance. In contrast, the focus of this endoscopic OCT probe can dynamically be adjusted at a high speed (500 mm/s) without changing reference arm length to obtain high quality OCT images for contact or non-contact tissue applications, or for areas of difficult access for probes. The dynamic focusing range of the probe can be from 0 to 7.5 mm without moving the probe itself. The imaging depth is 2.8 mm and the lateral scanning range is up to 2.7 mm or 4.5 mm (determined by the diameter of different GRIN lens rods). Three dimensional imaging can be performed using this system over an area of tissue corresponding to the GRIN lens surface. The experimental results demonstrate that this GRIN lens rod based OCT system can perform a high quality non-contact in vivo imaging. This rigid OCT probe is solid and can be adapted to safely access internal organs, to perform front or side view imaging with an imaging speed of 8 frames per second, with all moving parts proximal to the GRIN lens, and has great potential for use in extremely compact OCT endoscopes for in vivo imaging in both biological research and clinical applications.},

In this case, an immersion method for optical clearing of biological tissues can provide a possible solution to this problem, because the application of biocompatible clearing agents can reduce light scattering. Optical clearing represents a promising approach to increasing the imaging depth for various techniques, for example, various spectroscopy and fluorescent methods, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). We investigate the improvement of light penetration depth in blood after application of polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, propylene glycol, and hemoglobin solutions using an OCT system. Influence of clearing agents on light transport in tissues and blood was also investigated in the mouse tail vein.},

abstract = {Interferometric measurement of the vibration of the organ of Corti in the isolated guinea pig cochlea was conducted using low-coherence light (1310+/-47 nm wavelength) from a superluminescent diode. The short coherence length of the light source localized measurements along the axial direction to within a approximately 10-microm window (in tissue), even when using a low numerical-aperture lens. The ability to accomplish this is important because measurement of the vibration of the basal-turn organ of Corti is generally done via a small hole in the bone of the cochlea, which effectively limits the numerical aperture. The axial localization, combined with the inherent sensitivity of the method, allowed distinct measurements of the basilar membrane (BM) and the putative reticular lamina (RL) vibration using only the native tissue reflectance, that is without requiring the use of reflective particles. The system was first operated in a scanning mode as an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to yield an image of the organ of Corti. The reflectance of intensity from the BM and RL was 8x10(-5) and 8x10(-6), respectively. The internal structure between the BM and RL presented a variable reflectivity of about 10(-7). A mirror would define a reflectance of 1.00. Then the instrument was operated as a homodyne interferometer to measure the displacement of either the BM or RL. Vibration at 16 kHz was induced by a piezoelectric actuator, causing whole movement of a dissected cochlea. After calibration of the system, we demonstrated clear measurement of mechanically driven vibration for both the BM and RL of 0.30 nm above a noise floor equivalent to 0.03 nm. OCT interferometry, when adapted for in vivo organ of Corti measurements, appears suitable to determine the micromechanical vibration of cells and tissue elements of the organ.},

abstract = {Reduced cochlear blood flow (CoBF) is a main contributor to hearing loss. Studying CoBF has remained a challenge due to the lack of available tools. Doppler optical microangiography (DOMAG), a method to quantify single-vessel absolute blood flow, and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF), a method for measuring the relative blood flow within a large volume of tissue, were used for determining the changes in CoBF due to systemic hypoxia in mice. DOMAG determined the change in blood flow in the apical turn (AT) with single-vessel resolution, while LDF averaged the change in the blood flow within a large volume of the cochlea (hemisphere with ∼1 to 1.5 mm radius). Hypoxia was induced by decreasing the concentration of oxygen-inspired gas, so that the oxygen saturation was reduced from >95\% to ∼80\%. DOMAG determined that during hypoxia the blood flow in two areas of the AT near and far from the helicotrema were increased and decreased, respectively. The LDF detected a decrease in blood flow within a larger volume of the cochlea (several turns averaged together). Therefore, the use of DOMAG as a tool for studying cochlear blood flow due to its ability to determine absolute flow values with single-vessel resolution was proposed.},

abstract = {Sound transduction within the auditory portion of the inner ear, the cochlea, is a complex nonlinear process. The study of cochlear mechanics in large rodents has provided important insights into cochlear function. However, technological and experimental limitations have restricted studies in mice due to their smaller cochlea. These challenges are important to overcome because of the wide variety of transgenic mouse strains with hearing loss mutations that are available for study. To accomplish this goal, we used spectral domain optical coherence tomography to visualize and measure sound-induced vibrations of intracochlear tissues. We present, to our knowledge, the first vibration measurements from the apex of an unopened mouse cochlea.},

@article{Jacob2009,
abstract = {Laser interferometry is the technique of choice for studying the smallest displacements of the hearing organ. For low intensity sound stimulation, these displacements may be below 1 nm. This cannot be reliably measured with other presently available techniques in an intact organ of Corti. In a heterodyne interferometer, light is projected against an object of study and motion of the target along the optical axis causes phase and frequency modulations of the back-reflected light. To recover object motion, the reflected light is made to interfere with a reference beam of artificially altered frequency, producing a beating signal. In conventional interferometers, this carrier signal is demodulated with analog electronics. In this paper, we describe a digital implementation of the technique, using direct carrier sampling. In order to obtain the necessary reference signal for demodulation we introduce an additional third light path. Together, this results in lower noise and reduces the cost of the system. Within the hearing organ, different structures may move in different directions. It is therefore necessary to precisely measure the angle of incidence of the laser light, and to precisely localize the anatomical structure where the measurement is performed. Therefore, the interferometer is integrated with a laser scanning confocal microscope that permits us to map crucial morphometric parameters in each experiment. We provide key construction parameters and a detailed performance characterization. We also show that the system accurately measures the diminutive vibrations present in the apical turn of the cochlea during low-level sound stimulation.},

abstract = {The extraordinary sensitivity of the mammalian ear is commonly attributed to the cochlear amplifier, a cellular process thought to locally boost responses of the cochlear partition to soft sounds. However, cochlear power gain has not been measured directly. Here we use a scanning laser interferometer to determine the volume displacement and volume velocity of the cochlear partition by measuring its transverse vibration along and across the partition. We show the transverse displacement at the peak-response location can be >1,000 times greater than the displacement of the stapes, whereas the volume displacement of an area centred at this location is approximately tenfold greater than that of the stapes. Using the volume velocity and cochlear-fluid impedance, we discover that power at the peak-response area is >100-fold greater than that at the stapes. These results demonstrate experimentally that the cochlea amplifies soft sounds, offering insight into the mechanism responsible for the cochlear sensitivity.},

abstract = {We report studies of the analyses of and compensation for group dispersion to improve the axial resolution of high-speed optical coherence tomography (OCT) by acousto-optic modulation (AOM). Theoretical modeling and experiments reveal that the high-order group dispersion induced by acousto-optic crystals broadens the measured coherence length (Lc) and thus degrades the axial resolution of OCT imaging. Based on our experimental studies, we can compensate for the dispersion to less than 50\% broadening of the source Lc by adjusting the grating-lens-based optical delay in the reference arm and can further eliminate it by inserting like acousto-optic crystals in the sample arm of the OCT system. The results demonstrate that this AOM-mediated OCT system permits high-performance OCT imaging at A-scan rates of as much as 4 kHz by use of a resonant scanner. Because of its ultrastable direct frequency modulation, this AOM-mediated OCT system can potentially improve the performance of high-speed Doppler OCT techniques.},

@article{Ren2002,
abstract = {In the normal mammalian ear, sound vibrates the eardrum, causing the tiny bones of the middle ear to vibrate, transferring the vibration to the inner ear fluids. The vibration propagates from the base of the cochlea to its apex along the cochlear partition. As essential as this concept is to the theory of hearing, the waveform of cochlear partition vibration has yet to be measured in vivo. Here I report a "snapshot" (the instantaneous waveform of cochlear partition vibration) measured in the basal turn of the sensitive gerbil cochlea using a scanning laser interferometer. For 16-kHz tones, the phase delay is up to 6pi radians over the observed cochlear length (<1,000 microm), and instantaneous waveforms show sound propagation along the cochlear partition, supporting the existence of the cochlear traveling wave. The detectable basilar membrane response to a low-level 16-kHz tone occurs over a very restricted ( approximately equal 600 microm) range. The observed vibration shows compressive nonlinear growth, a shorter wavelength, and a slower propagation velocity along the cochlear length than previously reported. Data obtained at different frequencies show the relationship between the longitudinal pattern and frequency tuning, demonstrating that the observed localized traveling wave in this study is indeed the spatial representation of the sharp tuning observed in the frequency domain.},
